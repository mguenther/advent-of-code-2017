# Advent of Code 2017

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/), implemented using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). This is my first exposure to Kotlin, so some of the code presented in this repository might not be as idiomatic as a Kotlin veteran would expect. Nonetheless, I tried to implement clean solutions, sometimes for the sake of a better performing alternative.
